## What is it?
A curated list of Present Things such as frameworks, libraries, software and resources. All items on this list must follow present manifesto.

### For a programming language
1. works with latest version of the language
2. repos/links must be active and reachable(e.g. last commit is within this year)
3. give some gimps to indicate the quality of best practice libraries(not nessesary being popular)


## How to make it reality?
1. use github app to automate most of it
    1. automatic discovery
    2. automatic accept pull requests
2. easily allow expert to take parts in mantain it.
3. use automatic discovery from trustable sources like podcasts


## Why? I created this.
I am a fan of awesome list, especially awesome python, my favorite language, but I hate the way many of them maintain the list. You can see that

0. the list is OUTDATED!!
1. the list is filled with YESTERDAY AWESOME libraries.
2. Overflow with issues and pull requests
3. Those issues and pull requests keeps getting larger and larger.
4. It takes virtually infinite time for someone to response others.

Something have to change!
